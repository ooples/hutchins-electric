## üöÄ Part 1: Getting Your Computer Ready (15 minutes)

Think of this like installing the right tools before fixing electrical stuff.

### Step 1.1: Install Node.js (Your Website's Engine)

**What this is:** Node.js is like the engine that runs your website. Just like a car needs an engine, your website needs Node.js.

- [ ] Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) in your web browser
- [ ] Click the big green button that says "Download Node.js" (it should say something like "20.xx.x LTS")
- [ ] Run the downloaded file (it's like installing any other program)
- [ ] Keep clicking "Next" and "Yes" until it's done
- [ ] Restart your computer when it's finished

**What you'll see:** A download page with a big green button, then installation windows that look like any software installation.

**If something goes wrong:** Make sure you clicked the "LTS" version (the stable one). If it won't download, try a different web browser.

### Step 1.2: Install VS Code (Your Website Editor)

**What this is:** VS Code is like Microsoft Word, but for websites. It's where you'll make changes to your website.

- [ ] Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [ ] Click "Download for Windows" (or Mac if you have a Mac)
- [ ] Install it just like you installed Node.js
- [ ] Open VS Code when installation is complete

**What you'll see:** A blue and white website with a download button, then VS Code opens looking like a fancy text editor.

**If something goes wrong:** Try closing and opening VS Code again. It might take a minute to load the first time.

### Step 1.3: Open Your Command Prompt (The Magic Control Panel)

**What this is:** Think of this like the control panel for your website. It looks scary but we'll only use simple commands.

**For Windows:**
- [ ] Press the Windows key + R
- [ ] Type "cmd" and press Enter
- [ ] A black window with white text should open

**For Mac:**
- [ ] Press Command + Space
- [ ] Type "Terminal" and press Enter
- [ ] A window with white or black background should open

**What you'll see:** A black or white window with some text and a blinking cursor. This is normal!

**If something goes wrong:** Don't panic! Close the window and try again. You can't break anything from here.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Part 2: Getting Your Website Files (10 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Navigate to Your Website Folder

**What this is:** Like finding the right folder on your computer where your website lives.

- [ ] In your command prompt, type this exactly (copy and paste is fine):
```
cd C:\Users\yolan\source\repos\HutchinsElectric\hutchins-electric
```
- [ ] Press Enter
- [ ] You should see the path change to show you're in the right folder

**What you'll see:** The prompt changes to show the folder name. If you see "hutchins-electric" in the path, you're in the right place!

**If something goes wrong:** Double-check the path. Make sure the folder exists. If you get "cannot find path" error, the folder might be in a different location.

### Step 2.2: Install Website Dependencies (The Website's Tools)

**What this is:** Like downloading all the tools your website needs to work. Think of it like getting all the parts before assembling something.

- [ ] Type this command and press Enter:
```
npm install
```
- [ ] Wait for it to finish (this might take 5-10 minutes)
- [ ] You'll see lots of text scrolling by - this is normal!
- [ ] When it's done, you'll see your prompt again

**What you'll see:** Lots of downloading messages and progress bars. It might look confusing, but just let it do its thing.

**If something goes wrong:** If you see "ERROR" in red, try running the command again. Make sure you're connected to the internet.

### Step 2.3: Test Your Website Locally

**What this is:** Like testing your electrical work before connecting it to the main power. We're making sure everything works on your computer first.

- [ ] Type this command:
```
npm run dev
```
- [ ] Wait until you see "Ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000"
- [ ] Open your web browser
- [ ] Go to: http://localhost:3000
- [ ] You should see your website!

**What you'll see:** Your beautiful Hutchins Electric website should appear in your browser. It might not have all features working yet, but you should see the homepage.

**If something goes wrong:** Make sure the command is still running (don't close the black window). Try refreshing the browser page.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** If you can see your website in the browser, you're doing great! Time for a coffee break if you want.

## üóÑÔ∏è Part 3: Setting Up Your Database (30 minutes)

**What this is:** A database is like a filing cabinet for your website. It stores all the customer quotes, bookings, and information. We're using something called Supabase - think of it as a super-smart digital filing cabinet that lives on the internet.

### Step 3.1: Create Your Supabase Account

**What this is:** Like signing up for an email account, but for your database.

- [ ] Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) in your web browser
- [ ] Click "Start your project" or "Sign Up"
- [ ] Choose "Continue with GitHub" (this is easier)
- [ ] If you don't have GitHub, click "Sign up with email" instead
- [ ] Follow the prompts to create your account
- [ ] Check your email and click the verification link

**What you'll see:** A professional-looking website with green colors. The signup process looks like signing up for any other service.

**If something goes wrong:** Make sure you're using a valid email address. Check your spam folder for the verification email.

### Step 3.2: Create Your Database Project

**What this is:** Like creating a new folder for all your Hutchins Electric business data.

- [ ] Once logged in, click "New Project"
- [ ] Choose your organization (probably your username)
- [ ] Fill in the project details:
  - **Name:** hutchins-electric
  - **Database Password:** Create a STRONG password and write it down!
  - **Region:** Choose "US East" (closest to Vermont)
- [ ] Click "Create new project"
- [ ] Wait 2-3 minutes for setup (grab a snack!)

**What you'll see:** A form asking for project details, then a loading screen with a progress bar.

**If something goes wrong:** If it takes more than 5 minutes, refresh the page. Make sure you wrote down your database password - you'll need it!

### Step 3.3: Set Up Your Database Tables (The Filing System)

**What this is:** Like creating different folders in your filing cabinet for quotes, bookings, customers, etc.

- [ ] In your Supabase dashboard, look for "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
- [ ] Click "SQL Editor"
- [ ] Click "New Query"
- [ ] Open VS Code on your computer
- [ ] Open the file: `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- [ ] Copy ALL the text from that file (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
- [ ] Go back to Supabase and paste it in the SQL Editor
- [ ] Click "Run" (the play button)
- [ ] Wait for it to finish

**What you'll see:** A text editor in Supabase where you can paste code, then success messages when it runs.

**If something goes wrong:** Make sure you copied the entire file. If you see red error messages, try running it again.

### Step 3.4: Get Your Database Connection Keys

**What this is:** Like getting the keys to your filing cabinet so your website can access it.

- [ ] In Supabase, click "Settings" in the left sidebar
- [ ] Click "API" under Settings
- [ ] You'll see three important things - copy each one:

**Copy these (click the copy button next to each):**
- [ ] **Project URL** (starts with https://)
- [ ] **anon public key** (very long string starting with "eyJ")
- [ ] **service_role key** (another very long string starting with "eyJ")

**IMPORTANT:** Keep these safe! Write them down or save them in a text file. These are like your house keys!

**What you'll see:** A page with boxes containing long strings of letters and numbers, with copy buttons next to them.

**If something goes wrong:** If you can't find the API page, look for "Settings" then "API". The keys should be clearly labeled.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** You now have a database! Your website has a place to store customer information.

---

## üìß Part 4: Setting Up Email (20 minutes)

**What this is:** Your website needs to send emails to customers (like "Thanks for your quote request!") and to you (like "New customer wants a quote!"). We're using Resend - think of it as a super-reliable email service for businesses.

### Step 4.1: Create Your Resend Account

**What this is:** Like signing up for email service, but specifically for your website.

- [ ] Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
- [ ] Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
- [ ] Enter your email and create a password
- [ ] Verify your email address
- [ ] Complete your profile:
  - Company name: "Hutchins Electric"
  - Use case: "Transactional emails"

**What you'll see:** A clean, simple signup form similar to other services you've used.

**If something goes wrong:** Check your spam folder for the verification email. Make sure you're using the email address you actually check.

### Step 4.2: Get Your Email API Key

**What this is:** Like getting a special password that lets your website send emails.

- [ ] In your Resend dashboard, look for "API Keys"
- [ ] Click "Create API Key"
- [ ] Name it: "Hutchins Electric Website"
- [ ] Keep all the default permissions
- [ ] Click "Create"
- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Copy the key immediately and save it - you won't see it again!

**What you'll see:** A form to create an API key, then a long string of letters and numbers that you need to copy.

**If something goes wrong:** If you lose the key, just create a new one. You can have multiple keys.

### Step 4.3: Test Email Sending (Optional but Recommended)

**What this is:** Like testing if your phone can make calls before giving out your number.

For now, we'll set this up to work with Resend's test domain. Later, you can add your own domain for more professional emails.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Your website can now send emails! Customers will get confirmation emails and you'll get notifications.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Part 5: Connecting Everything Together (15 minutes)

**What this is:** Like connecting all the wires in an electrical project - we're telling your website how to talk to your database and email service.

### Step 5.1: Create Your Environment File

**What this is:** A secret file that stores all your passwords and keys safely.

- [ ] In VS Code, open your hutchins-electric folder
- [ ] Look for a file called `.env.example`
- [ ] Right-click on it and select "Copy"
- [ ] Right-click in an empty space and select "Paste"
- [ ] Rename the copy to `.env.local` (exactly like that)
- [ ] Open the `.env.local` file

**What you'll see:** A file with lines that look like `SOMETHING=placeholder_value`

**If something goes wrong:** Make sure the file is named exactly `.env.local` with a dot at the beginning.

### Step 5.2: Fill in Your Secret Information

**What this is:** Like filling in a form with all your account information.

Replace the placeholder values with your real information:

- [ ] **NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=** (paste your Supabase Project URL here)
- [ ] **NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=** (paste your Supabase anon key here)
- [ ] **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=** (paste your Supabase service role key here)
- [ ] **RESEND_API_KEY=** (paste your Resend API key here)
- [ ] **RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=** noreply@hutchinselectric.com (or your domain)

**What you'll see:** Lines of text where you replace the parts after the = sign with your actual keys.

**If something goes wrong:** Double-check that you didn't accidentally delete the = signs or add extra spaces.

### Step 5.3: Test Everything Works

**What this is:** Like flipping the switch to see if your electrical work is complete.

- [ ] Go back to your command prompt (the black window)
- [ ] If your website is still running, press Ctrl+C to stop it
- [ ] Start it again with: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- [ ] Try filling out the quote form (use your real email)
- [ ] Check if you received an email
- [ ] Check your Supabase dashboard to see if the quote was saved

**What you'll see:** Your website should work perfectly now! Forms should save data and send emails.

**If something goes wrong:** Check that all your keys are copied correctly in the `.env.local` file. Make sure there are no extra spaces.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** Everything is connected! Your website can now save customer data and send emails.

## üåê Part 6: Putting Your Website on the Internet (45 minutes)

**What this is:** Like connecting your house to the power grid - we're making your website available to everyone on the internet. We'll use Vercel, which is like a hosting service that makes this super easy.

### Step 6.1: Create GitHub Account (If You Don't Have One)

- [ ] Create a strong password
- [ ] Verify your email

**What you'll see:** A signup form similar to other websites, then a welcome page.

```
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial website setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hutchins-electric-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

**What you'll see:** Your website files appearing on the GitHub website.

**If something goes wrong:** If you're stuck on this step, use Option A (the website method). It's more visual and easier to understand.

**What you'll see:** A deployment screen with progress bars, then a celebration screen with your live website URL.

**If something goes wrong:** If deployment fails, check the error logs. Most common issue is missing environment variables (next step).

### Step 6.5: Add Your Secret Keys to Vercel

**What this is:** Like giving Vercel copies of your keys so your live website can access your database and email service.

- [ ] In your Vercel project, click "Settings"

  - Click "Add"
  - Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - Value: (paste your Supabase URL)
  - Environment: Production, Preview, Development
  - Click "Save"
- [ ] Repeat for all variables:

## üè† Part 7: Getting Your Own Domain (30 minutes)
